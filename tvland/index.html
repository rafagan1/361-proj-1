  <h1>Which is the better option?</h1>
  <p>Both services have their pros and cons. Cable TV is</p>
  <p>more expensive than streaming services such as DirecTV Now,</p>
  <p>YouTube, Hulu, or Sling TV. However, you generally get more</p>
  <p>channels with Cable TV. Streaming TV also require a high speed</p>
  <p>internet connection, while cable does not.</p>
